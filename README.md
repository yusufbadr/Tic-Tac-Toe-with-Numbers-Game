# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Numbers-Game
## Rules:
- Player 1 is given the following set of odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
- Player 2 is given the following set of even numbers: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
- Each number can be used only once.
- Player 1 always starts first.
- First player to **complete** a line (whether it is vertical, horizontal or diagonal) in which the sum of the numbers of that line is 15 (regardless of whether the numbers are even or odd) wins the game. If the board is full and no player won then the game is considered to be a draw.
